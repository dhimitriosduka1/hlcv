This repository contains implementations of various assignments and a project related to the High-Level Computer Vision course. Each assignment is organized in separate folders as outlined below:

- **Assignment 1**: Exercises and code related to the first assignment.
- **Assignment 2**: Exercises and code related to the second assignment.
- **Assignment 3**: Exercises and code related to the third assignment.

## Project: Acoustic Guitar Chord Recognition

This system automates **chord recognition** from acoustic guitar videos by detecting and classifying chords based on video input. It leverages **YOLO** and **Faster R-CNN** for fretboard detection, allowing the system to identify the position of the hand and fingers on the guitar neck. For chord classification, it utilizes **Vision Transformers** and **DINOv2**, which process visual cues to distinguish between different chords. Additionally, **hand pose estimation** was explored as a potential method to perform chord recognition.
