  abstract       = {Artificial intelligence, particularly machine learning, has begun to permeate various real-world applications and is continually being explored in automatic music generation. The approaches to music generation can be broadly divided into two categories: rule-based and data-driven methods. Rule-based approaches rely on substantial prior knowledge and may struggle to handle large datasets, whereas data-driven approaches can solve these problems and have become increasingly popular. However, data-driven approaches still face challenges such as the difficulty of considering long-distance dependencies when handling discrete-sequence data and convergence during model training. Although the diffusion model has been introduced as a generative model to solve the convergence problem in generative adversarial networks, it has not yet been applied to discrete-sequence data. This paper proposes a transformer-based diffusion model known as MelodyDiffusion to handle discrete musical data and realize chord-conditioned melody generation. MelodyDiffusion replaces the U-nets used in traditional diffusion models with transformers to consider the long-distance dependencies using attention and parallel mechanisms. Moreover, a transformer-based encoder is designed to extract contextual information from chords as a condition to guide melody generation. MelodyDiffusion can automatically generate diverse melodies based on the provided chords in practical applications. The evaluation experiments, in which Hits@k was used as a metric to evaluate the restored melodies, demonstrate that the large-scale version of MelodyDiffusion achieves an accuracy of 72.41% (k = 1).},

  abstractnote = {&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Initiated in 1999, Automatic Chord Recognition (ACR) primarily relied on audio data, facing challenges, especially with high timbre sounds, which led to a shift towards visual methods for recognizing guitar chords due to their distinct hand configurations. This project explores visual guitar chord identification, harnessing fretboard features, including hand arrangements and positions. It also investigates the limited advantages of transfer learning due to the absence of pertinent pre-trained weights. The developed model employs deep learning, DCNN methodologies, and techniques like normalization, attening, and dropout to identify 14 major and minor keys without fret position restrictions. Enhanced by data augmentation, a self-compiled dataset of over 13,000 samples from 10 contributors effectively trains the model for new data. After testing 115 new examples, the system achieved an 83% accuracy on both live and pre-recorded video data. These results demonstrate the feasibility of employing a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) focused visual approach for guitar chord identification. Furthermore, this study suggests exciting potential for future advancements in the Music Information Retrieval (MIR) field.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;},
