%%%%%%%%% BODY TEXT
\section{Task and Motivation}
Automatic cord recognition (ACR) consists of recognizing the chords being played in a music piece. This information is quite valuable since it can later be used for music analysis, music transcription and other similar tasks. ACR was first introduces in 1999 by \cite{takuya1999realtime} where the author utilized lisp music to perform chord recognition at the signal level. Since then, many different approaches have been introduced \cite{}. However, these methods approached the task from an audio signal processing prespective which proved to be quite challenging and not very accurate. 

% With the rise of deep learning, and especially Computer Vision, many researches started to tackle this problem from a different perspective. 

% The approach has proved to be quite successful and has shown to be more accurate than the traditional audio signal processing methods.

However, to our knowledge, there is no research that tackles the problem of recunstruction the audio being played in a video.

\section{Methods}

What models/frameworks do you use to solve the challenges?

Why can the proposed method / analysis solve your problem?

What are the main differences between your method and existing methods (if applicable)?

What is the required computational budget for the training/analysis? (E.g. are you planning on using pretrained backbones?)

\section{Datasets}

What datasets are you going to use/collect and why?


\subsection{Fretboard Detection}
This one has both: \cite{guitar-chords-daewp_dataset}. 
Only fretboard: \cite{guitar-ppfil_dataset}, \cite{done-npcll_dataset}.

\subsection{Chord Recognition}
For chord recognition: \cite{guitar-chord-tvon8_dataset}, \cite{guitar-chord-bounding-box_dataset}, \cite{guitar-chord-handshape_dataset}.

\subsection{Seamless Audio Generation}
\emph{GuitarSet}, a dataset that provides high quality acoustic guitar recordings alongside time-aligned annotations including fret positions, chords, among others \cite{Xi2018}.

\section{Evaluation}

How is your method going to be evaluated?

What metrics are suitable?

Do you need to define your own metric for evaluation?
