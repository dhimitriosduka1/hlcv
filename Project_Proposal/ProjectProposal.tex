% It is strongly recommended to use hyperref, especially for the review version.
% hyperref with option pagebackref eases the reviewers' job.
% Please disable hyperref *only* if you encounter grave issues, e.g. with the
% file validation for the camera-ready version.

% If you comment hyperref and then uncomment it, you should delete
% ReviewTempalte.aux before re-running LaTeX.
% (Or just hit 'q' on the first LaTeX run, let it finish, and you
%  should be clear).
